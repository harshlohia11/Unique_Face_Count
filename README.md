# Unique_Face_Count
In this project we will count number of unique or distinct faces that appears in any given video file

To run the python file you need to create <b>images</b> folder in the same directory as your python code and video/mp4 file. In the images folder we will be automatically extracting all the frames of the video per second in the video and the compare the faces in the images and count the distinct faces in the code.
